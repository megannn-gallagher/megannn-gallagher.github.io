        <h1>Contributor Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p>We have a few basic rules you must follow when contributing to this site.
            These rules are in place to ensure we remain a reliable source for information on company ethics, 
            and to reduce the spread of misinformation.</p>
        <p>Any breach of this policy, or any other policy, will lead to action being taken including suspension from contributing, and bans.</p>
        <p>Any questions about this policy should be sent to codeofconduct-questions@example.com.</p>

            <li>Be civil, but feel free to debate on the discussion pages.</li>
            <li>You must add any conflicts of interest, or anything which could be perceived as a conflict of interest, to your profile.<br /> An example of this is working for a company which has a profile on this website. Only our independent auditors can see this.</li>

            <li>You must not publish any new information on this site. This site is designed to summarise publicly available information about companies; whistleblowers are not allowed.</li>
